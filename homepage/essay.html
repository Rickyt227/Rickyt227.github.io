       <p> The Seaport </p>
       <p> The South street Seaport is my home, and I can't imagine leaving it. I've lived here my whole life, and have made countless memories here,  Whether it's with my friends at Pier 17 or with my family at the places we frequent.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite memories in the Seaport was at <a href="http://rooftopatpier17.com">Pier 17</a>. I got a text from my friend Lucas asking if we wanted to go hang out at Pier 17. Matthew, Jack, and I all responded yes.When we arrived there we saw a huge inflatable monkey and heard someone performing on the top floor. Out of curiosity we asked an employee what was going on, they responded saying that it was “Ape Fest”. After doing a little bit of exploring we saw swarms of people pouring down the escalators mostly holding handfuls of “Ape Fest” bags. At this point my friends Jack and Lucas had to go home so it was just me and Mathew. We thought the bags were cool so we decided to try to persuade people to give us one of their many bags. Roughly one out of every ten people would give us a bag, and after doing this for between twenty to thirty minutes we had more bags than we knew what to do with. We were on our way home when we saw someone successfully selling the bags, so we decided to do the same. After looking around for a little bit we found the perfect “victims”, a group of guys waiting in line to get two for twenty two dollars tacos. We walked up to them and asked if they were interested and they jumped onto the opportunity. They gave us every dollar in their pockets for the bags each paying more than the last. After selling all the bags we were willing to part with Matthew and I walked out of there with one hundred and five dollars each.</p>
        <p>Before covid on the corner of Peck Slip and South street was my family’s home away from home, a neighborhood bar/restaurant called “The Paris Cafe”. It was the type of place where when you walked you knew everybody and everyone knew you. It's where my parents, older cousins, and I spent a lot of weekends  hanging out with friends and eating delicious food. I had two things I always got when I went there, the asian style wings, and their nachos, which were the best nachos I've had to this day. At the beginning of covid when my family found out that The Paris was being forced to close down for good we all were heart broken, and lost a little piece of ourselves.</p>
        <p>Since losing The Paris we have found another neighborhood spot that gets a similar crowd. It is a very similar type of place but even though it tries to be and we try to convince ourselves it is, it will never live up to The Paris.</p>
        <p>The seaport represents NYC through its diversity. All classes and categories of people come to the seaport for a variety of reasons. You have upper class people coming to enjoy the fine dining in the area, you have middle class people who live there and call it their home, you have countless homeless people who have been on the same street corner my whole life.</p>
